# Medical Agent

## Overview

The Medical Agent is a sophisticated AI-powered healthcare analysis system designed to provide in-depth medical insights and support through specialized sub-agents. Each sub-agent focuses on a distinct medical domain to deliver comprehensive and nuanced information, aiding in preliminary understanding and research.

## Agent Architecture

The Medical Agent uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

-   **Medical Agent**: The root agent that orchestrates the entire medical inquiry process by delegating tasks to the Sub Agent Coordinator.
-   **Sub Agent Coordinator**: Coordinates all specialized sub-agents and synthesizes their outputs into a comprehensive medical overview or report.
-   **Sub-Agents**: Each sub-agent is responsible for a specific domain of medical analysis.

## Tools and APIs Used

Each sub-agent leverages specific tools to perform its analysis:

| Sub-Agent                | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cardiology Agent         | Retrieves information on cardiovascular conditions, treatments, and research.               |
| Dermatology Agent        | Gathers data on skin conditions, diagnoses, and dermatological procedures.                  |
| Neurology Agent          | Collects information on neurological disorders, brain function, and related research.       |
| Orthology Agent          | Finds information on musculoskeletal conditions, orthopedic treatments, and rehabilitation. |
| Psychiatry Agent         | Retrieves data on mental health conditions, therapies, and psychiatric research.            |
| Pediatrics Agent         | Gathers information on childhood diseases, development, and pediatric care.                 |
| General Medical Agent    | Provides broad medical information and acts as a fallback for uncategorized queries.        |

| Main-Agent               | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sub Agent Coordinator    | Coordinates all the Sub Agents and delegate the prompt based on Sub Agent specialization    |
| Medical Agent            | Interacts with the user and conveys the prompt to the Sub Agent Coordinator                 |

All sub-agents use the `gemini-2.0-flash` model for LLM-based reasoning .

## Key Features

- Modular, multi-agent design for specialized medical analysis across various domains.

- Each sub-agent focuses on a distinct medical discipline (Cardiology, Dermatology, Neurology, Orthology, Psychiatry, Pediatrics, General Medicine).

- Provides comprehensive overviews or preliminary research insights based on user queries.

- Designed to assist in understanding complex medical topics.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+

- Google Cloud Project with the following roles assigned:
  - Vertex AI User
  - Storage Admin
  - Service Usage Consumer
  - Logs Viewer

Once you have created your project, [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). Then run the following command to authenticate:
```bash
gcloud auth login
```

You also need to enable certain APIs. Run the following command to enable:
```bash
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

## Agent Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    # On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    # On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies::
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure settings:
   - Set the following environment variables. You can set them in your `.env` file (modify and rename `.env.example` file to `.env`) or set them directly in your shell. For example:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="True"
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="my-project-id"
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="my-region"
   ```



## Usage

Run the agent:
```bash
adk web
```
